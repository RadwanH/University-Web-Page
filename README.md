# University-Web-Page
### This is a university website I made as a part of a **HomeWork**  with the requirements that are found in the [PDF](https://github.com/RadwanH/University-Web-Page/blob/main/BIM222_HW1.pdf) file attached  ###

###### Although the website is not pretty much responsive (it is not required to be responsive) it is still not that awful on mobile thanks to the css approach I followed 

#### you can view the website from [**HERE**](https://radwanh.github.io/University-Web-Page/).
